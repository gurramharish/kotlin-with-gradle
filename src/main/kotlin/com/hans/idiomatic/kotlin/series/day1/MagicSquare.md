# Magic Square

1. A magic square is when you do sum of each row or a column or a diagonal is equal.
1. Magic square exists for all n > 2
1. all permutations of 3 times magic square is for 9(3 * 3) digits is:
    9 * 8 * 7..... * 1 = 362880
   
1. In all the squares sum is 45 for 3 magic square 9 digits sum is (n * n(n + 1)) / 2

4S = 3S + 3*center
3 * center = S

Finding S for 4 * 4 matrix.
1. First find sum of 16 numbers is 16 * (16 + 1) / 2 = 136
1. 136 is the sum of all the values in 4 rows or 4 columns so each row or column should sum to 136/4 = 34
